You are working on FINBAR v1 (personal investment dashboard for Bar).

Always read:
- docs/FINBAR_CONTEXT.md
before writing code.

Hard rules:
- UI language: Hebrew only.
- RTL everywhere by default (dir="rtl"), do not break layout.
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript. Prefer server actions / route handlers where appropriate.
- Supabase Auth + Postgres with RLS. Never bypass user scoping. Always filter by auth.uid().
- Do not add scope (no graphs/advanced analytics/importing brokers) unless explicitly asked.
- Calculations must be correct: store original currency, convert for display using USDILS.
- Implement Refresh: one button triggers price+fx fetch and saves snapshots to reduce API calls.
- Never include secrets in code. Use env vars and .env.local.
- Always Read FINBAR_Context.md before writing Code.

Code style:
- Small components, clear naming, minimal dependencies.
- Validate inputs (zod recommended).
- Prefer reusable UI components and clean layout.
